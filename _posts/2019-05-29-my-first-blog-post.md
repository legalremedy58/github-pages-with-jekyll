Today was not very fun. I made sure to get dressed and ready for school in time today, but it was raining cats and dogs, and that messed everything up. Class was very annoying and the teachers were being a bother, or at least it seemed that way due to my horrible headache. in the end, i used all the mney i had left over to buy a spoiled drink and my mom couldnt give me the time of day in the car. i hpe my day at home isnt as bad
